                For this outfit, I decided to use this blue and black Vans flannel as the centerpiece.
                It's funny because prior to coming to Yale, I rarely incorproated blue into my outfits because my high school's colors were red and black.
                Now that Harvard is my sworn enemy, I find myself wearing red a lot less often.

                This picture was taken outside of a Goodwill in Los Angeles, California.
                Although this background is a little busier than solid-colored ones, its abstract design contrasts well with the geometric pattern of my flannel.
                Additionally, the plant theme of the background connects it to my outfit because of the butterfly on my shirt, a small detail that I, and hopefully you, appreciate.
            </p>

                The butterfly shirt, strap bag, and black nylon shorts were purchased online on SHEIN.
                I was hyped when I found the flannel at my local Value Village for $5 because that is a steal of a deal for a Vans flannel in good condition.
                It's safe to say that thrifting for clothes has become one of my favorite hobbies.
                I am wearing the Nike Blazer Mid '77 Vintage sneakers again like in my previous outfit.

                For jewelry, the only thing I have on is my cross necklace, which is my favorite out of all the chains I have.
                As for the hat, I don't even like the Chicago White Sox or baseball in general, but MLB hats are considered stylish because of their design and logos.
                I purchased the hat at Big 5 Sporting Goods for a mere $10.

                My second outfit release earned a personal rating of 4 out of 5 stars.
                The accessories really sold it for me, specifically the hat and strap bag.
                I think this outfit would look even better had I worn black jeans instead of black shorts,
                but it was way too warm in Los Angeles to be wearing pants.
