            <p>
                Welcome to my first outfit release featuring clothing from brands like H&M, North Face, and Nike.
                I chose to highlight this outfit first because beige and olive are my favorite colors to wear and match.
                Color combinations like this one commonly occur in nature.
                These earthy tones have become popular in streetwear lately due to their visual appeal.

                This picture was taken at a parking garage in my hometown of Bellingham, Washington.
                The red "No Skateboarding" graffiti on the wall adds a nice pop to the background.
                Posing with my face cropped out of the frame also helps to keep the focus of the image on the clothing.
            </p>

                In the sneakerhead community, the focus of the entire outfit is centered around the shoe, but I am not that uptight about it.
                Here, I am wearing the Nike Blazer Mid '77 Vintage shoe, 
                which has recently become one of the most popular sneakers due to their affordability and versatility with outfits.

                The shirt and crewneck I'm wearing are basic, solid-colored pieces from H&M, which is one of my go-to stores.
                The North Face cargo pants were a hidden treasure I found at my local Goodwill.
                I recently started wearing jewelry because it became popular in men's fashion through social media trends.
                The cross necklace I have was purchased on Etsy, 
                and I've just been collecting rings from everywhere over the months.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I gave this outfit a personal rating of 3 out of 5 stars.
                Although I really do like to wear beige and olive,
                this outfit is a little basic in terms of design.
                The solid-colored clothing makes for an average outfit.
                A "statement piece" or more accessories could bring this outfit up to a 4-star rating.
