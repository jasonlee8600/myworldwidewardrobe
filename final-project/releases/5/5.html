            <p>
                Here, I decided to try on an outfit comprised mainly of my favorite color: orange.
                Brown is my favorite color to wear, but orange has always been my favorite color in general.
                Although not a true orange, this peachy shade is still very appealing to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                This image was taken against a brick wall in Silliman.
                The white tile floor complimented the color, position, and pattern of my shoes perfectly.
                I posed with my head down and hands in my pockets, but I got a little spicy with the foot up against the wall.
                This picture may look nice, but it was really awkward to ask a random student leaving the dining hall to take it for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thrifted this shirt at my local Burlington Coat Factory store,
                and the "B. Cools" on it is short for Barney Cools, a popular clothing company based in Australia.
                The gold necklaces from H&M also go well with the yellow wording on the shirt as the secondary color for this outfit.
                The peach shorts are from a Vans outlet store, and they are my favorite shorts to wear during the summertime.
            </p>

                The sneakers I am wearing are the Vans Checkerboard Slip-ons.
                Vans shoes were originally popular within the skateboarding fashion community, but they've become sought after in streetwear because of their affordability.
                Mine are a little beat up because I wear these sneakers pretty often, but I like to think that this visible wear and tear gives the shoe some character.
                Lastly, the black, beaded bracelet was just a little accessory I threw on to add a little more black to the outfit.
            </p>

            <p>
                This outfit deserves a checkered 4 out of 5 stars.
                I am a little biased because orange is my favorite color,
                but the contrast between the abstract shirt pattern and checkered shoe pattern
                really helps elevate this outfit.
