            <p>
                For this outfit, I decided to go with a brown and tan color scheme.
                Aside from the gold detailing, wearing only different tones of brown is an example of a monochromatic outfit, which is a popular style in streetwear.
            </p>

            <p>
                This picture was taken in the common area of my summer dorm in Silliman.
                The dark brown wooden shelf behind me helped add to the monochromatic effect. 
                I wish the burgundy single-seated couch was some shade of brown as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thrifted the beige, thin-striped shirt at my hometown's Value Village.
                The dark mocha shorts were purchased online at SHEIN.
                For my accessories, I threw on my gold necklaces from H&M for a change instead of my silver cross.
                I purchased the San Diego Padres hat at a hat store called Lids. 
                The Padres' gold logo worked well with my gold jewelry as the secondary color of the outfit.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sneakers I am wearing are definitely the highlight of the outfit.
                These are the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2's Sesames.
                Yeezy's are extremely hyped up in the sneakerhead community because they are designed by Kanye West.
                They resell online for almost double or triple their retail price.
                There are many different Yeezy shoe models, but the 350 V2 model is the most popular one.
            </p>

            <p>
                A rating of 3 out of 5 stars is fitting for this outfit.
                It would be rated higher if my shirt and shoes were exactly the same shade of beige,
                and my shorts and hat were the exact same shade of mocha brown.
                The slight variations in shade makes the monochromatic style a little less cohesive.
