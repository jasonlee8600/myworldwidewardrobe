                I decided to go with a black and yellow theme here, almost like a bumblebee.
                Side note: Bumblebee is also my favorite Transformer.
                It is scientifically proven that yellow is the color that the human eye notices first because it is the most visible, making this outfit a real attention-grabber.

                This picture was taken on the streets of New Haven, against an ad right next to Yorkside Pizza.
                My poses are always intentional, but having the tiger's face cropped out so that it matches mine was unintentional.
                Also, the tiger stripes kind of match the camoflauge pattern of my pants.
                I appreciate little details like these because they help add to the image.

                I thrifted the Harley Davidson shirt at my hometown's local Goodwill.
                I was really excited to find a yellow shirt I finally liked because I've been trying to expand the colors of my wardrobe.
                Once again, I just threw on my silver cross chain and black strap bag as accessories.

                I purchased these camoflauge jogger pants at Hollister.
                As for my sneakers, I purchased these Adidas Ultraboost 4.0's on a popular sneaker reselling website called StockX.
                Ultraboosts are a very popular sneaker because the midsole is made out of a comfortable, cloud-like material that Adidas calls "Boost".

                A less favorited outfit, I gave this one a rating of 2 out of 5 stars.
                My main motivation for choosing this outfit was to expand the colors of my wardrobe,
                but yellow is just a hard color to work with in fashion.
                I think this outfit could be improved with small, yellow accessories 
                or pants and shoes with minimal yellow detailing.
